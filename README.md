> "How would you define the concept of 'Enactive Design'? How does it relate to the concept of 'Enactivism' in the cognitive sciences?"

### GTP-4o

RESPONSE # 0

Enactive Design is an approach that integrates principles from enactivism in cognitive science into the design process. Enactivism is a theoretical framework in the cognitive sciences that emphasizes the active role of organisms in shaping their environment and cognition. It proposes that cognition arises through a dynamic interaction between an organism and its environment, rather than being a process of passive information processing.

Enactive Design, therefore, focuses on creating environments, products, or systems that facilitate this dynamic interaction between users and their surroundings. It encourages designers to think of users as active participants whose experiences and actions are integral to the design process. This approach often involves iterative design practices that adapt to users' evolving needs and promote engagement, learning, and adaptation.

The relationship between Enactive Design and enactivism lies in their shared emphasis on interaction and experience. Enactive Design applies the principles of enactivism by considering how users actively engage with and make sense of their environment through their actions. It seeks to create designs that support this experiential and participatory nature of cognition, often resulting in more intuitive, user-centered, and adaptive solutions.

Overall, Enactive Design leverages the insights from enactivism to create more meaningful and effective interactions between people and the systems or environments they inhabit.

Short definition

Enactive design is a design approach that treats products, services, and environments as partners in people’s ongoing activity, not as channels for delivering information. It aims to shape the sensorimotor couplings, feedback loops, and social interactions through which users “bring forth” meaning, skills, and practices. In other words, it designs for enactment—how people will move, feel, coordinate, and learn with an artifact in real situations—rather than for static functions or mental representations.

Relation to enactivism

Enactivism in cognitive science holds that cognition is embodied, situated, and enacted: it arises from an autonomous agent’s active coupling with its environment. Key ideas include:
- Sense-making: meaning is generated in activity, not looked up in the head.
- Structural coupling and adaptivity: agent and environment co-adapt over time.
- Autonomy: living systems maintain their own organization and norms of viability.
- Participatory sense-making: in social settings, coordination itself is a cognitive process.

Enactive design applies these ideas to practice:
- From representation to sense-making: design does not try to encode meanings in interfaces; it shapes conditions so users can discover and refine them through action.
- From features to skills and practices: success is measured by the emergence of fluent, situated know-how (e.g., a tool that helps people learn a movement, workflow, or habit).
- From user-to-product to system coupling: the unit of design is the human–artifact–environment system, including materials, layout, rhythms, and other people.
- From optimization to viability: designs are judged by how they sustain autonomous, flexible activity in real contexts, not only by task-time or error rates.
- From control to co-creation: users are treated as autonomous agents; methods emphasize participatory, in-situ exploration of practices as they form.

Typical principles and methods
- Design the coupling: craft perceptual–motor loops (timing, resistance, haptics, spatial layout) that invite desirable actions.
- Leave openness: maintain “give” or indeterminacy so users can appropriate and adapt, allowing practices to evolve.
- Prototype enactments: bodystorming, role-play, experience prototyping, and live, in-context trials to study breakdowns, recovery, and learning.
- Evaluate experience-in-use: focus on feel, fluency, coordination, and how routines stabilize over time; include participatory sense-making in multi-user settings.
- Ethics of autonomy: prefer scaffolding and invitation over covert manipulation; support users’ own norms and goals.

Examples
- A rehabilitation device that provides graded haptic feedback so patients relearn a movement by feel, rather than showing targets to hit.
- A workspace layout and tangible tools that make handoffs and coordination visible and easy, letting a team’s rhythms self-organize.
- An educational toy whose resistive and sonic responses guide exploratory play, helping children enact concepts through action.

In sum, enactive design is the practical translation of enactivism: it treats cognition as something people do with bodies, materials, and others, and it designs those relationships so meaningful activity can emerge and grow.
